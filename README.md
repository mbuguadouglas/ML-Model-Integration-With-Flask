# Simple Machine Learning Model Integration with Flask
In this beginner friendly project, i build a simple ML model based on the popular Iris flower dataset. The model is used to predict the iris flower species based on 4 input features namely:
- Sepal Length 
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
Depending on the input varibale, the model could predict the flower to belong to either of three varieties, either `verisicolor`, `virginica` or `setosa`.

# Web Inteface
The main page of the web application looks as below:
! [Home Page] (interface/before_input.png)

One will enter the respective features into the text boxes as below:
! [Home Page Input] (interface/during_input.png)

The web app then displays the results as shown below:
